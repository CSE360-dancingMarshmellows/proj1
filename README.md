# proj1
I ADDED AN OLD PROJECT ON GUI SO WE CAN USE A REFERENCE. THE PROJECT IS LOCATED IN A DIFFERENT REPOSITORY SO WE DONT CONFUSE THEM SINCE THERES NO WAY OF ADDING FOLDERS


WE WILL CREATE DIFFERENT FILES FOR DIFFERENT CLASSES. WE WILL EDIT AND I BELIEVE WE WILL HAVE PERMISSION TO CHANGE IT. PLEASE JOT DOWN IDEAS ON HOW TO PROGRAM THIS. IF YOU CODE SOMETHING, ADD IT HERE AND WE CAN ADD TO THE FILE. HONESTLY, I FEEL LIKE TWO PEOPLE SHOULD CODE TO REDUCE CONFUSION. OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT..... IDK... FML...
